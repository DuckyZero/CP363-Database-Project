# CP363 Database Project
Student Record Database Management System

## Project Description
The database  would  contain  general  student  information  (such  as  name,  address, contact information, admission year, courses, major(s) etc.), attendance information, grade information, scholarship information, etc. The above information is just examples. It is your responsibility to design the database. However, it will be better that the database you design has information for students who are taking both major and minor degrees. It will be better that the database you design has the information of domestic and international students.
